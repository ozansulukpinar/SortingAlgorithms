## General info

To arrange a sequence of numbers in ascending order, sorting algorithms help. In this project, some of them implemented in different programming languages.

## Technologies

Project is created with:

- C#
- Javascript
- C

## Features

List of features ready

- Solve algorithm questions

## Status

Project is completed.

## Inspiration

A computer science course, [CS50 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR6nycuZKlM), has inspired solving these sorting algorithms.
